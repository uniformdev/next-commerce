# Next.js Commerce enabled by Uniform

This starter is based on the latest Next.js Commerce template and built with Next.js 14 and App Router.

[Demo](https://nextjscommerceuniform.vercel.app/). Experience edge personalization [by adding ?utm_audience=hipsters query string](https://nextjscommerceuniform.vercel.app/?utm_audience=hipsters) where the main product tile will change based on context.

In addition to the goodness Next.js Commerce provides, this starter provides the following benefits for marketers and merchandisers:

- Visual in-line editing of content in Uniform including PDPs
- Dynamic page layout control without code
- Integrated edge personalization and A/B testing
- Dynamic route control without code (including Product Detail Pages)
- Ability to connect to a couple of dozen Headless CMS and Commerce catalog APIs, full list [here](https://docs.uniform.app/docs/integrations).
- Dynamic site navigation control (top and footer nav)

## Running locally

1. Have an empty Uniform project ready

1. Install Fake Commerce integration into it and name it "Fake Commerce" with `fakeCommerce` public id (important).

1. You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js Commerce. It's recommended you use local env vars for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

   See `.env.example` as a reference:

   ```bash
   UNIFORM_API_KEY=
   UNIFORM_PROJECT_ID=
   UNIFORM_PREVIEW_SECRET=nextcommerce

   TWITTER_CREATOR="@uniformdev"
   TWITTER_SITE="https://uniform.dev"
   SITE_NAME="JavaDrip.js"

   ```

   > Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets

1. Run these commands in CLI:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm push
   pnpm dev
   ```

   > In order to run `pnpm push`, your `UNIFORM_API_KEY` must have the Developer role permissions.

1. Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
